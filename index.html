    <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p1>
        I am a mental health clinician, licensed in the Maryland and Texas. I was first exposed to software applications
        when I worked as an Analyst/Consultant for a leading Electronic Medical Records system on several
        implementations. This gave me the opportunity to work with other programs which were integrated with the EMR I
        was working with. I found myself intrigued by computer systems and how a string of alphanumeric data could be so
        powerful.
        While managing projects, I am always captivated by the expertise of developers and their ability to translate
        everyday needs into program functionality. In a bid to understand the granular details that come with
        programming, I decided to enroll in a six-month bootcamp. While I continue to run a small private practice, I
        believe that a healthy understanding of programming language could make me a better clinician. The attention to
        detail is a skill required and possessed by programmers and clinicians alike.
